            In-Toto is a framework to secure the software supply chain. It
            ensures that the software was built and delivered securely. We start
            at the developers machine. It will create a post-commit hook, which
            records all file hashes of the project. This information is send to
            devguard. During the continous integration process intoto will be
            used to record input and outputs. During operation the whole
            software supply chain will be end-to-end verified.
