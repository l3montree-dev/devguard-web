<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

FlawFix is a vulnerability management that fits perfectly into any IT environment and ensures mitigation of vulnerabilities and complete documentation of the handling processes. It aims to be compliant to various security frameworks, like ISO 27001 or German BSI Grundschutz.
With FlawFix you can easily go through the vulnerability management process: 

1. Consolidation of vulnerabilities
2. Enhancing the data
3. Risk Assessment
4. Selection of the mitigation type
5. Sharing of the vulnerability information to responsible parties
6. Reporting
